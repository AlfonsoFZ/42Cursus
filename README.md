42 Malaga Projects

In this repo I will try to upload all the codes related to the 42 Malaga projects.
As you can find a lot of resources related to this projects avaible in other repos, 
I will not include subjects or any other indication it these repos.

Please note that these projects are done to be evaluated in MACOS, but a lot of code 
has been written in linux so maybe you can find some crossed reference or maybe you 
need to change some parts of then before compilation. 

First project once I was accepted in 42 Málaga was about creating your own library
in C replicating some of the standart library.
